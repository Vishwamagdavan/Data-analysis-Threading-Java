Data Analytics using Java Multi threading 

Data analysis. Let's say, you have 100 000 000 random words and you want to find out things like the average word length, longest word, shortest word, most common words, etc.

You can first write a non-threaded version and see how long it takes to find the stats you wanted to find. Then you can add multi-threading by simply splitting the word analysis to multiple threads and then in the end combining the outputs of all those threads together to give you the final stats.
